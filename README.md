pygtk-craigslist
================

We're going to use PyGUI because it looks like the best cross platform candidate. Please somone volunteer to help me so I can get this this off of the ground! Thanks.

A graphical front-end for craigslist, which will also have extra features such as timed spider to search what you're looking for without you around, and notifiy you by email, or text, etc. Hopefully some other people will notide the lack of this application an join in with their own awesome ideas!
